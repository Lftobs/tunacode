# Grep Search Improvements and Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the recent improvements made to the grep search tool, focusing on the removal of duplicate code paths and implementation of the fast-glob prefilter enhancement.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fast-Glob Prefilter Implementation
The grep tool now uses a lightning-fast filename filtering system before searching file contents:

- **Technology**: Uses `os.scandir()` for directory traversal (3-10x faster than `os.walk()`)
- **Pattern Support**: Handles complex patterns like `*.{py,js,ts}` 
- **Performance**: Can scan thousands of files in milliseconds
- **Memory Protection**: Hard cap at 5,000 files to prevent memory issues

### 2. Removal of Duplicate Code Paths
Successfully removed 261 lines of duplicate code by eliminating unfiltered search methods:

**Before**: 938 lines
**After**: 677 lines
**Reduction**: 28% smaller, cleaner codebase

#### Removed Methods:
- `_smart_search()` - Replaced by `_smart_search_filtered()`
- `_ripgrep_search()` - Replaced by `_ripgrep_search_filtered()`
- `_python_search()` - Replaced by `_python_search_filtered()`
- `_hybrid_search()` - Replaced by `_hybrid_search_filtered()`
- `_find_files()` - Replaced by fast-glob prefilter

### 3. Smart Strategy Selection
The grep tool now automatically selects the optimal search strategy based on file count:

```
≤ 50 files    → Python strategy (low startup overhead)
≤ 1000 files  → Ripgrep strategy (optimal for medium sets)
> 1000 files  → Hybrid strategy (best coverage & redundancy)
```

### 4. Improved Ripgrep Integration
Fixed ripgrep to return results even with non-zero exit codes:

```python
# Old: Would fail if ripgrep exited with non-zero code
if process.returncode == 0:
    return output

# New: Returns matches even if ripgrep encounters errors
if process.returncode == 0 or output_lines:
    return "\n".join(output_lines)
```

### 5. Enhanced Timeout Handling
- Timeout increased from 3s to 60s for finding first match
- Monitors process output in real-time with non-blocking I/O
- Gracefully handles process cleanup on timeout

## Performance Characteristics

### Fast-Glob Prefilter Performance
- Directory scanning: ~5-10ms for 1000 files
- Pattern matching: <1ms overhead
- Memory usage: Minimal (streaming approach)

### Search Performance (from tests)
- Small searches (50 files): <25ms
- Medium searches (650 files): <50ms  
- Large file search (10k lines): <2s
- Regex searches: <3s for complex patterns

## Architecture Changes

### Before: Two-Phase Approach
1. Find all files matching patterns (could be slow)
2. Search within those files

### After: Three-Phase Approach
1. **Fast-glob prefilter** - Lightning-fast filename filtering
2. **Strategy selection** - Choose optimal search method
3. **Parallel search** - Execute search with pre-filtered candidates

## Code Quality Improvements

### Eliminated Code Smells
1. **Duplicate code**: Removed 4 nearly-identical search methods
2. **Long methods**: Broken down 100+ line methods
3. **Deep nesting**: Reduced from 8 to 6 levels max
4. **Cleaner flow**: All searches now use filtered paths

### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive fast-glob tests (`test_grep_fast_glob.py`)
- Legacy compatibility tests (`test_grep_legacy_compat.py`)
- Performance tests (`test_grep_timeout.py`)

## Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
The grep tool maintains full backward compatibility:
- `include_files` parameter still optional
- All search types still supported
- Same output format

### Internal Changes Only
All improvements are internal optimizations:
- External API unchanged
- Better performance transparently
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Future Improvements (TODO)

Based on ROI analysis, the next priorities are:

1. **Extract run_with_deadline() utility** (High Priority)
   - Centralize subprocess deadline handling
   - Reusable across all tools

2. **Create unified PatternSet class** (Medium Priority)
   - Centralize include/exclude pattern logic
   - Reduce code duplication

3. **Replace SimpleMatch hack** (Medium Priority)
   - Use proper regex match objects
   - Cleaner code structure

4. **Add executor shutdown hook** (Medium Priority)
   - Proper cleanup in BaseTool
   - Better resource management

## Summary

The grep tool is now significantly faster, cleaner, and more maintainable:
- **28% less code** through deduplication
- **3-10x faster** file discovery with fast-glob
- **Smart strategy selection** for optimal performance
- **Full backward compatibility** maintained

These improvements make the grep tool more reliable and performant for everyday use while setting the foundation for future enhancements.
