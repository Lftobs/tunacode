# Architect Mode Fixes - 2025-06-15

## Problem Summary

When using architect mode with requests like "tell me about this codebase", the system exhibited several issues:

1. **Multiple Agent Responses**: Each ReadOnlyAgent task execution produced its own TunaCode response box, resulting in 5 separate responses instead of one consolidated response.

2. **Timeout Issues**: Tasks were timing out after 30s, particularly with `ls -R` commands and even simple `ls` commands, suggesting inefficient command execution.

3. **Poor Error Recovery**: The feedback loop would retry the same failing commands instead of using alternative approaches.

4. **Response State Tracking**: The orchestrator would add summary responses even when agents had already provided output, leading to redundant information.

## Root Causes

1. **No Response Aggregation**: In `adaptive_orchestrator.py`, each task result was added directly to `all_results`, causing multiple agent responses to be displayed.

2. **Inefficient Commands**: The system was using recursive `ls -R` commands which are slow for large directories.

3. **Missing Pattern Recognition**: The request analyzer didn't recognize "tell me about this codebase" as an `ANALYZE_CODEBASE` request type.

4. **No list_dir Tool in ReadOnlyAgent**: The ReadOnlyAgent only had bash, grep, and read_file tools, forcing it to use bash for directory listing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Response Consolidation (adaptive_orchestrator.py)

Modified `_execute_with_feedback` to aggregate outputs instead of returning multiple results:

```python
# Track aggregated output from all tasks
aggregated_outputs = []
has_any_output = False

# In the batch results loop:
if exec_result.result and hasattr(exec_result.result, "result") and exec_result.result.result:
    if hasattr(exec_result.result.result, "output") and exec_result.result.result.output:
        aggregated_outputs.append(exec_result.result.result.output)
        has_any_output = True

# At the end, return a single consolidated response:
if has_any_output:
    combined_output = "\n\n".join(aggregated_outputs)
    return [ConsolidatedRun(combined_output)]
```

### 2. Added list_dir Tool (readonly.py)

Added the `list_dir` tool to ReadOnlyAgent for efficient directory listing:

```python
from ...tools.list_dir import list_dir

# In tool list:
Tool(list_dir),
```

### 3. Improved Request Analysis (request_analyzer.py)

Added pattern for "tell me about this codebase":

```python
RequestType.ANALYZE_CODEBASE: [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    (
        r"(?:tell\s+me\s+about|describe|what\s+is)\s+(?:this\s+)?(?:code|codebase|project)",
        Confidence.HIGH,
    ),
],
```

Added handler for ANALYZE_CODEBASE in `generate_simple_tasks`:

```python
elif intent.request_type == RequestType.ANALYZE_CODEBASE:
    # Generate standard analysis tasks
    tasks.extend([
        {
            "id": task_id,
            "description": "List the contents of the current directory",
            "mutate": False,
            "tool": "list_dir",
            "args": {"directory": ".", "max_entries": 100},
        },
        # ... other analysis tasks ...
    ])
```

### 4. Better Command Handling (adaptive_orchestrator.py)

Enhanced `_format_tool_request` to handle problematic commands:

```python
elif tool == "bash":
    command = args.get("command", "")
    # Handle special cases for better commands
    if "ls -R" in command:
        return "Use list_dir tool to list directory contents"
    elif command.strip() in ["ls", "ls -la", "ls -l"]:
        return "Use list_dir tool to list current directory"
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Response**: Users now see one consolidated response instead of multiple separate boxes.
2. **Faster Execution**: Using `list_dir` instead of bash `ls` commands avoids timeouts.
3. **Better UX**: The system properly recognizes and handles common requests like "tell me about this codebase".
4. **Improved Error Handling**: The system avoids retrying failing commands with the same approach.

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
- Request analyzer properly identifies "tell me about this codebase" as ANALYZE_CODEBASE
- Simple task generation creates appropriate tasks for codebase analysis
- Response consolidation combines multiple outputs into a single response

All components tested successfully with the fixes in place.
