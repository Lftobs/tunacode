# Features

TunaCode is a powerful AI-powered CLI coding assistant with comprehensive features for developers.

## Core Features

### Multi-Provider Support

TunaCode supports multiple AI providers, giving you flexibility in choosing your preferred model:

- **Anthropic Claude** - Including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Haiku models
- **OpenAI GPT** - GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and other OpenAI models
- **Google Gemini** - Gemini 2.0 Flash and other Google models
- **OpenRouter** - Access to 100+ models through a single API
- **Any OpenAI-compatible API** - Support for custom endpoints

### Developer Tools

TunaCode includes 7 core tools designed for efficient coding:

1. **bash** - Enhanced shell command execution with safety features
2. **grep** - Fast parallel content search across files with 3-second deadline
3. **glob** - Fast file pattern matching using glob patterns
4. **list_dir** - Efficient directory listing without shell commands
5. **read_file** - Read file contents with line numbers
6. **update_file** - Modify existing files with precise replacements
7. **write_file** - Create new files (fails if file exists)

Additional developer features:
- Direct shell command execution with `!` prefix
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for extensibility
- File operation confirmations with diffs
- Per-project context guides (CLAUDE.md)
- JSON tool parsing fallback for API compatibility
- Fast code indexing system for efficient file discovery
- Memory anchor system for persistent code navigation

### Safety & Control

TunaCode prioritizes safety with these features:

- **Git branch integration** (`/branch`) - Create and switch branches easily
- **No automatic commits** - All git operations require explicit user action
- **Explicit file operation confirmations** - Review changes before they're applied
- **Permission tracking per session** - Know what the AI has access to
- **`/yolo` mode for power users** - Skip confirmations when you're confident

### Architecture Benefits

Built on modern foundations:

- **pydantic-ai** - Type-safe AI agent framework
- **Async throughout** - Non-blocking operations for better performance
- **Modular command system** - Easy to extend and customize
- **Rich UI with syntax highlighting** - Beautiful terminal interface
- **ReAct reasoning patterns** - Transparent AI decision-making

## Performance Features

### Parallel Tool Execution

TunaCode automatically optimizes tool execution for better performance:

- **Read-only tools execute in parallel** - `read_file`, `grep`, `list_dir`, and `glob` run concurrently
- **3x performance improvement** - Significantly faster multi-file operations
- **Automatic batching** - Consecutive read-only tools are batched together
- **Safety preserved** - Write/execute tools remain sequential to prevent conflicts
- **Configurable parallelism** - Control via `TUNACODE_MAX_PARALLEL` environment variable

### Code Indexing System

Fast in-memory code index for efficient repository navigation:

- **Instant file lookups** - No more timeout-prone grep searches for file discovery
- **Smart filtering** - Ignores common build/cache directories automatically
- **Symbol indexing** - Tracks classes, functions, and imports in Python files
- **Directory caching** - Efficient directory content lookups
- **Incremental updates** - Refresh specific files or directories as needed

### Search Optimizations

- **Fast-glob prefiltering** - Grep tool uses glob patterns to filter candidates before content search
- **3-second search deadline** - Prevents overly broad patterns from hanging the system
- **Multiple search strategies** - Smart strategy selection based on file count and pattern complexity
- **Result ranking** - Intelligent sorting and deduplication of search results

### Memory Anchor System

Persistent code navigation system optimized for LLM interactions:

- **In-file anchors** - Use `CLAUDE_ANCHOR[key]: description` format in docstrings and comments
- **Persistent references** - Navigate to code sections even after refactoring
- **Semantic context** - Anchors provide meaningful descriptions of code functionality
- **Cross-session memory** - Maintain understanding across different sessions
- **Automatic mapping** - `.claude/anchors.json` tracks anchor locations
- **LLM-optimized** - Designed specifically for AI code understanding and navigation

Example anchor usage:
```python
"""Main agent implementation for TunaCode.

CLAUDE_ANCHOR[main-agent-module]: Core agent with parallel tool execution
"""
```

## Reliability Features

### JSON Tool Parsing Fallback

TunaCode automatically handles API provider failures with robust JSON parsing:

- **Automatic Recovery**: When structured tool calling fails, TunaCode parses JSON from text responses
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports inline JSON, code blocks, and complex nested structures
- **Manual Recovery**: Use `/parsetools` when automatic parsing needs assistance
- **Visual Feedback**: See `ðŸ”§ Recovered using JSON tool parsing` messages during fallback

### Enhanced Error Handling

- **Tool Schema Fixes**: Consistent parameter naming across all tools
- **Orphaned Tool Call Recovery**: Automatic cleanup with `/fix` command
- **Configuration Refresh**: Update settings without restart using `/refresh`
- **ReAct Reasoning**: Configurable iteration limits for complex problem solving

## Bash Tool Features

The enhanced bash tool provides advanced shell command execution:

- **Working Directory Support**: Execute commands in specific directories
- **Environment Variables**: Set custom environment variables for commands
- **Timeout Control**: Configurable timeouts (1-300 seconds) to prevent hanging
- **Output Capture**: Full stdout/stderr capture with truncation for large outputs
- **Safety Checks**: Warns about potentially destructive commands
- **Error Guidance**: Helpful error messages for common issues

Example usage by the AI:
```python
# Simple command
await bash("ls -la")

# With working directory
await bash("npm install", cwd="/path/to/project")

# With timeout for long operations
await bash("npm run build", timeout=120)

# With environment variables
await bash("python script.py", env={"API_KEY": "secret"})
```
