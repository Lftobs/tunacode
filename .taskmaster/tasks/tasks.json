        "details": "Locate the safety branch warning implementation in the TunaCode codebase. Examine how ANSI color codes are being applied and why they're rendering as visible text instead of formatting. Check if the issue is in the prompt generation, color utility functions, or terminal output handling. Review related UI components to understand the expected color formatting patterns.\n<info added on 2025-07-22T21:28:22.937Z>\nRoot cause identified: The issue is in `/home/fabian/tunacode/src/tunacode/ui/tool_ui.py` in the `show_sync_confirmation` method (lines 157-159). Rich console interprets square brackets `[` and `]` as markup tags for formatting. When displaying options like `\"  [1] Yes (default)\"` using `ui.console.print()`, Rich attempts to parse `[1]` as a markup tag, fails, and displays raw ANSI escape codes instead. The solution requires escaping the square brackets or using Rich's Text object to display literal text without markup interpretation. This affects the sync confirmation dialog used when async operations aren't available.\n</info added on 2025-07-22T21:28:22.937Z>",
