# New Context-Aware Architect Mode Demo

## Overview

The new architect mode implements the Frame → Think → Act → Loop pattern for intelligent task execution:

1. **Frame**: Quickly detects project context (type, framework, structure)
2. **Think**: Analyzes requests and generates context-aware tasks
3. **Act**: Executes tasks efficiently with parallel reads
4. **Loop**: Learns from findings and adapts next steps

## Key Features

### 1. Fast Project Context Detection
- Uses cached CodeIndex for O(1) file lookups
- Detects project type (Python, Node.js, Rust, Go, Java, etc.)
- Identifies frameworks (Django, Flask, React, Express, etc.)
- Finds source directories, test directories, and config files

### 2. Smart Task Generation
Instead of generic tasks like:
- `ls -R` (times out)
- `find . -name "*"` (too broad)
- Reading every file

We generate targeted tasks:
- For Python/Django: Look for settings.py, models.py
- For Node.js/React: Look for components, package.json
- For Rust: Check Cargo.toml and main.rs

### 3. Adaptive Feedback Loop
- Extracts findings from completed tasks
- Generates follow-up tasks based on discoveries
- Limits iterations to avoid runaway execution
- Consolidates outputs into single response

## Example: "Tell me about this codebase"

### Before (Old Architect Mode)
```
Tasks:
1. List current directory
2. Read README.md (hardcoded)
3. Run bash: find . -name "*.toml" (times out)
4. List src directory (may not exist)

Result: Multiple response boxes, timeouts, generic output
```

### After (New Architect Mode)
```
Frame: Python project (fastapi) | Sources: src
Tasks:
1. [10] List current directory
2. [9] Read README.md
3. [9] Read pyproject.toml for configuration
4. [8] Find FastAPI routes
5. [7] List src directory contents

Result: Single consolidated response with project overview
```

## Performance Improvements

1. **Context Detection**: < 50ms (uses cached index)
2. **Task Generation**: < 10ms (no LLM calls for common patterns)
3. **No Timeouts**: Replaced bash commands with efficient tools
4. **Parallel Execution**: Read tasks run concurrently

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. `src/tunacode/core/analysis/project_context.py` - Fast project detection
2. `src/tunacode/core/analysis/task_generator.py` - Context-aware task generation

### Modified Files
1. `request_analyzer.py` - Uses project context for smarter analysis
2. `adaptive_orchestrator.py` - Implements Frame → Think → Act → Loop
3. `readonly.py` - Added list_dir tool support

### Key Classes
- `ProjectContext`: Detects and caches project information
- `AdaptiveTaskGenerator`: Generates tasks based on project type
- `ProjectInfo`: Data class with project metadata

## Usage

1. Enter architect mode: `/architect`
2. Ask about the codebase: `tell me about this codebase`
3. Watch as it:
   - Frames the context (detects Python/fastapi)
   - Thinks (generates targeted tasks)
   - Acts (executes tasks in parallel)
   - Loops (adapts based on findings)
   - Replies with consolidated overview

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more project types (C++, Ruby, PHP)
2. Detect more frameworks (Svelte, Nuxt, Gin)
3. Extract dependency information
4. Generate architecture diagrams
5. Identify coding patterns and conventions
