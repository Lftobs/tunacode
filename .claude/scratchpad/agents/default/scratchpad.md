# Debugging get_tool_description string indices error

[1] [1] Found error in node_processor.py:410 when calling get_tool_description
[2] [2] get_tool_description expects Dict but appears to receive string - checking part.args structure
[3] [3] part.args can be either a string (JSON) or dict - parse_args handles both
[4] [4] Fixed by parsing JSON string args to dict before passing to get_tool_description
