[1] Analyzed current linting setup:
[1] - Black (formatter): 100 char line length
[1] - isort (import sorter): Black-compatible profile
[1] - flake8 (linter): 100 char line length, ignores Black conflicts
[1] - All tools in Makefile and dev dependencies
[2] Creating Ruff configuration to replace Black, isort, and flake8:
[2] - Ruff can handle formatting (replacing Black)
[2] - Ruff can sort imports (replacing isort)
[2] - Ruff includes all flake8 rules and more
[2] - Single tool, faster performance
[3] Created comprehensive ruff.toml configuration:
[3] - Mirrors existing Black formatting (100 char lines, double quotes)
[3] - Includes isort functionality with Black compatibility
[3] - Covers all flake8 rules plus many more
[3] - Added appropriate ignores for project conventions
[3] - Configured per-file ignores for tests and CLI
[4] Updated Makefile to use Ruff commands:
[4] - lint: ruff check --fix + ruff format (replaces black/isort/flake8)
[4] - lint-check: ruff check + ruff format --check (no modifications)
[4] - Simplified from 6 commands to 4 commands
[5] Updated pyproject.toml:
[5] - Replaced black, flake8, isort with single ruff>=0.8.0 dependency
[5] - Removed [tool.black] and [tool.isort] sections
[5] - Added comment pointing to ruff.toml for configuration
[6] Updated setup_dev_env.sh script:
[6] - Removed black, isort, flake8 version checks
[6] - Added Ruff version check
[6] - Updated make command description for lint
[7] Updated verify_dev_env.sh script:
[7] - Changed tool check loop to only check for ruff and pytest
[7] - Removed black, isort, flake8 from verification
[8] Removed old linter configuration:
[8] - Deleted .flake8 file
[8] - pyproject.toml already cleaned of black/isort sections
