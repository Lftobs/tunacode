_Started: 2025-06-21 11:22:32_

[1] All tests passing. Now searching for default iterations (20) and limit settings
[2] Found characterization test file. Now searching for the specific iteration/limit values in defaults.py and main.py
[3] Found the values to update: default 20->40 in defaults.py, max limit 50->100 in commands.py. Creating characterization test first
[4] Tests failed due to API mismatch. Need to fix CommandContext usage and imports
[5] Characterization tests passing. Now updating the values: default 20->40, limit 50->100
[6] Updated all values successfully. Running full test suite to ensure no regressions
