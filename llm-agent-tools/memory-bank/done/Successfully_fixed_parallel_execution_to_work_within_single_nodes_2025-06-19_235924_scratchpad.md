# Review parallel tool execution plan updates
_Started: 2025-06-19 23:42:39_

[1] Reviewed parallel-tool-execution-plan.md - discovered cross-node buffering issue
[2] Key issue: Agent sends one tool per node/iteration, preventing batching within nodes
[3] Current implementation shows 'missed optimization' messages but cannot truly batch due to pydantic-ai architecture
[4] Reviewed implementation: ToolBuffer created at request level, tracks tools across nodes
[5] Visual feedback shows 'missed optimization' messages and final batch execution
[6] Confirmed: Code executes tools sequentially in a loop, not using execute_tools_parallel
[7] Found the issue: buffering_callback still executes tools individually for compatibility
[8] Fixed implementation to actually use parallel execution when all tools in a node are read-only
