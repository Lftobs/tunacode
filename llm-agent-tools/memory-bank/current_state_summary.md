# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- Fixed configuration persistence bug when using CLI flags:
  - Issue: JSON config file failed to save when ~/.config directory didn't exist
  - Solution: Updated save_config to create directory with proper permissions (0o700)
  - Added proper error handling with ConfigurationError exceptions
  - Created comprehensive tests for directory creation and error scenarios
  - Updated CHANGELOG.md with all recent changes (context loading, characterization tests, config fix)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Consider bumping version to 0.0.34 for the config persistence fix
2. Test the config persistence fix in real environment with missing ~/.config
3. Continue with characterization tests for Main Agent
4. Consider enhancing context loading to merge multiple TUNACODE.md files intelligently

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Config directory creation now happens automatically with proper permissions
- Error messages are now visible to users instead of failing silently
- All config-related operations now properly propagate errors
