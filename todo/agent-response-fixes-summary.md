# Agent Response Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-08-03

### Problem
The agent was stopping unexpectedly after getting truncated or incomplete responses, particularly when using certain models like `openrouter:moonshotai/kimi-k2`.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Truncated Responses**: API responses being cut off mid-sentence
2. **Intention Without Action**: Agent describing what it will do without executing tools
3. **Empty Response Handling**: Not detecting various types of unproductive responses
4. **No Progress Tracking**: Agent could spin without making progress

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Truncation Detection (main.py lines 261-300)
- Detects responses ending with "..." or "â€¦"
- Checks for mid-word truncation (e.g., "referen" instead of "reference")
- Validates markdown code blocks are closed
- Checks for unclosed brackets/parentheses
- Triggers continuation when truncation detected

#### 2. Intention Without Action Detection (main.py lines 561-589)
- Identifies phrases like "Let me", "I'll", "I will", "I'm going to"
- Checks for action verbs (read, search, create, etc.) without tool calls
- Forces tool execution when intention is stated but no action taken

#### 3. Enhanced Empty Response Handling (main.py lines 1116-1146)
- Provides targeted retry messages based on empty reason:
  - **Truncated**: "Complete my thought and take action"
  - **Intention without action**: "Execute tools NOW, not just describe"
  - **Empty**: Standard reflection prompt
- Each retry type has specific guidance

#### 4. Progress Tracking (main.py lines 1181-1231)
- Tracks iterations without tool usage
- After 3 unproductive iterations, forces action
- Provides strong intervention: "NO MORE DESCRIPTIONS. Take ACTION or mark COMPLETE."

#### 5. System Prompt Enhancement (system.md lines 9-13)
Added critical behavior rules:
1. When saying "Let me..." must execute tools in SAME response
2. Never describe without doing
3. Use TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE when done
4. Handle truncation gracefully

### Technical Details

#### Modified Functions
- `_process_node()`: Now returns `(is_empty: bool, reason: str)` tuple
- Added variables: `appears_truncated`, `has_intention`, tracking logic
- Enhanced retry mechanism with reason-specific prompts

#### New Detection Patterns
- Truncation: `["referen", "inte", "proces", "analy", "deve", "imple", "execu"]`
- Complete endings: `["ing", "ed", "ly", "er", "est", "tion", "ment", "ness", "ity", "ous", "ive", "able", "ible"]`
- Intention phrases: `["let me", "i'll", "i will", "i'm going to", "i need to", "i should"]`
- Action verbs: `["read", "check", "search", "find", "look", "create", "write", "update", "modify", "run", "execute", "analyze", "examine", "scan"]`

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test with models known to truncate (e.g., kimi-k2)
2. Test with prompts that trigger "Let me..." responses
3. Verify progress tracking after 3+ iterations
4. Check TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE detection
5. Test parallel tool execution still works

### Success Metrics
- No more agent stopping on truncated responses
- Agents execute tools instead of just describing
- Clear intervention after unproductive iterations
- Proper task completion signaling
