# Aggressive Agent Response Fixes - Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-03

### The Core Problem
Agents (especially kimi-k2) were producing empty responses and getting stuck in unproductive loops.

### Key Changes Made

## 1. Immediate Aggressive Intervention (main.py ~line 1032)
**Old Behavior**: Wait for 3 empty responses before strong intervention
**New Behavior**: IMMEDIATE intervention on FIRST empty response

```python
# Changed from:
if state_manager.session.consecutive_empty_responses >= 3:

# To:
if state_manager.session.consecutive_empty_responses >= 1:
```

## 2. "YOU FAILED TRY HARDER" Prompt (main.py ~lines 1051-1068)
Replaced gentle nudging with aggressive prompt:

```
FAILURE DETECTED: You returned an empty response.
This is UNACCEPTABLE. You FAILED to produce output.

TRY AGAIN RIGHT NOW:
1. If your search returned no results → Try a DIFFERENT search pattern
2. If you found what you need → Use TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE
3. If you're stuck → EXPLAIN SPECIFICALLY what's blocking you
4. If you need to explore → Use list_dir or broader searches

YOU MUST PRODUCE REAL OUTPUT IN THIS RESPONSE. NO EXCUSES.
```

## 3. Context-Aware Failure Messages
- Shows recent tools used: `glob('**/*4R*')`, `grep('pattern')`
- Includes current iteration number
- Shows portion of original task
- Provides specific guidance based on what failed

## 4. Removed Gradual Escalation
- Deleted the 2-strike and 3-strike logic
- No more "gentle reflection" phase
- Straight to aggressive intervention

## 5. Enhanced Empty Detection (Previously Implemented)
- Detects truncated responses
- Catches "intention without action" patterns
- Identifies unproductive iterations

## 6. Premature Completion Prevention (Previously Implemented)
- Prevents TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE when tools are queued
- Warns about suspicious early completions
- Validates completion against stated intentions

### Example of New Behavior

**Before**:
```
Iteration 6: [Empty response]
System: "⚠️ EMPTY RESPONSE - CONTINUING"
Iteration 7: [Empty response]
System: "Let me reflect..."
Iteration 8: [Empty response]
System: "I need to be more decisive..."
Iteration 9: [Empty response]
System: "CRITICAL: Take action now"
```

**After**:
```
Iteration 6: [Empty response]
System: "⚠️ EMPTY RESPONSE FAILURE - AGGRESSIVE RETRY TRIGGERED"
System: "FAILURE DETECTED: You FAILED to produce output. TRY AGAIN RIGHT NOW!"
Iteration 7: [Agent forced to take concrete action]
```

### Benefits
1. **Faster Recovery**: No more waiting through multiple failures
2. **Clear Expectations**: Agent knows failure is unacceptable
3. **Context Preservation**: Shows what was tried before failing
4. **Forced Progress**: Can't get stuck in empty loops

### Testing Needed
- Test with kimi-k2 model specifically
- Test with search queries that return no results
- Test with tasks that might confuse the agent
- Verify aggressive prompts don't cause overcorrection
