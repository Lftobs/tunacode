# Agent Response Improvements - Complete Overview

## Date: 2025-08-03

## Executive Summary
We've implemented a comprehensive set of fixes to address agent response failures, including empty responses, truncated content, intention-without-action patterns, and premature task completion. The improvements make the agent more reliable and prevent it from getting stuck.

## Problems Identified and Solutions Implemented

### 1. Empty Response Detection & Recovery

**Problem**: Agents returning completely empty responses and getting stuck
**Solution**: Immediate aggressive intervention on first empty response

**Implementation Details**:
- Detection: Checks for empty content with no tool calls
- Intervention: Triggers on FIRST occurrence (changed from 3rd)
- Prompt: "FAILURE DETECTED: You returned an empty response. This is UNACCEPTABLE."
- Recovery: Forces immediate tool execution or substantial output

### 2. Truncation Detection

**Problem**: API responses being cut off mid-sentence (e.g., "Maybe **emoji E6** referen...")
**Solution**: Multi-pattern truncation detection

**Detection Patterns**:
- Ends with "..." or "…" (ellipsis)
- Mid-word endings: "referen", "inte", "proces", "analy", "deve", "imple", "execu"
- Unclosed markdown code blocks (odd number of ```)
- Unbalanced brackets/parentheses
- Missing common word endings

**Response**: Prompts agent to complete thought and continue action

### 3. Intention Without Action

**Problem**: Agent says "Let me check..." but doesn't execute tools
**Solution**: Detect intention phrases and force immediate action

**Intention Phrases Detected**:
- "let me", "i'll", "i will", "i'm going to", "i need to"
- "i should", "going to", "need to", "let's", "i can"
- "i would", "allow me to", "i shall", "about to", "plan to"

**Action Verbs Checked**:
- "read", "check", "search", "find", "look", "create"
- "write", "update", "modify", "run", "execute", "analyze"

**Response**: "CRITICAL: Execute tools in THIS response, not just describe"

### 4. Premature Task Completion

**Problem**: Agent marks task complete while tools are still queued (kimi-k2 issue)
**Solution**: Validate TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE against pending actions

**Validation Checks**:
- Blocks completion if tools are queued in same response
- Warns if completion attempted with stated intentions
- Checks iteration count (suspicious if <= 1)
- Logs premature completion attempts

### 5. Progress Tracking

**Problem**: Agent spins without making progress
**Solution**: Track unproductive iterations and force action

**Implementation**:
- Tracks iterations without tool usage
- After 3 unproductive iterations: "NO MORE DESCRIPTIONS. Take ACTION or mark COMPLETE."
- Monitors last productive iteration
- Forces concrete next steps

### 6. Enhanced Empty Response Handling

**Old Approach** (Gradual Escalation):
1. First empty: Gentle reflection
2. Second empty: Stronger guidance
3. Third empty: Force action

**New Approach** (Immediate Aggression):
1. First empty: "YOU FAILED TRY HARDER" with context
2. Shows recent tool usage
3. Demands immediate action
4. No gentle nudging

## Technical Implementation Summary

### Modified Functions

1. **`check_task_completion()`**
   - Returns (is_complete, cleaned_content)
   - Used for detecting TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE marker

2. **`_process_node()`**
   - Returns (is_empty, reason) tuple
   - Reasons: "empty", "truncated", "intention_without_action"
   - Handles all detection logic

3. **`process_request()`**
   - Main loop with intervention logic
   - Tracks consecutive failures
   - Injects recovery prompts

### Key Variables Added

- `has_non_empty_content`: Tracks if response has substance
- `appears_truncated`: Detects cut-off responses
- `has_intention`: Detects stated intentions
- `has_tool_calls`: Tracks if tools were executed
- `unproductive_iterations`: Counts iterations without progress
- `consecutive_empty_responses`: Tracks empty response streak

## System Prompt Enhancements

Added to system.md:
```markdown
**CRITICAL BEHAVIOR RULES:**
1. When you say "Let me..." you MUST execute tools in SAME response
2. Never describe without doing - ALWAYS execute tools
3. When complete, start with: TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE
4. If truncated, you'll be prompted to continue
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Response
```
Agent: [Empty response]
System: ⚠️ EMPTY RESPONSE FAILURE - AGGRESSIVE RETRY TRIGGERED
        Reason: empty
        Recent tools: glob('**/*r5*'), grep('pattern')
        YOU FAILED. TRY DIFFERENT SEARCH PATTERN NOW.
```

### Scenario 2: Intention Without Action
```
Agent: "Let me search for that file..."
System: ⚠️ INTENTION WITHOUT ACTION DETECTED
        You said "Let me search" - execute grep/glob NOW!
```

### Scenario 3: Premature Completion
```
Agent: "Let me check... TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE"
System: ⚠️ PREMATURE COMPLETION DETECTED
        Overriding - letting queued tools execute first
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Recovery**: No 3-strike waiting period
2. **Clear Expectations**: Failure is immediately unacceptable
3. **Context Preservation**: Shows what failed and why
4. **Forced Progress**: Can't spin in empty loops
5. **Better Completion**: Can't claim done without doing work

## Remaining Considerations

1. Some models (kimi-k2) may need model-specific handling
2. Could add fallback to different model after repeated failures
3. May need tuning for different task types
4. Monitor for over-aggressive corrections

## Files Modified

1. `/src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py` - Core logic changes
2. `/src/tunacode/prompts/system.md` - Behavior rules
3. `/src/tunacode/types.py` - ResponseState tracking

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with known problematic models (kimi-k2)
2. Test with searches that return no results
3. Test with ambiguous user requests
4. Verify truncation detection works
5. Confirm premature completion is blocked
