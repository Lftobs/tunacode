# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- Cleaned up dead code in the TunaCode codebase
- Removed TunaCodeCommand class - a fully implemented BM25 search feature that was disabled
- Eliminated 57 lines of unused code from src/tunacode/cli/commands.py
- Confirmed SimpleCommand base class is actively used by 13 commands (not dead code)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue finding and fixing nested conditionals that can be flattened with guard clauses
2. Look for more dead code patterns (unused functions, imports, variables)
3. Apply other small improvements like normalizing symmetries
4. Continue with characterization tests for Main Agent (`src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py`)

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Focus on code cleanup and refactoring patterns from the style guide
- Prioritize removing dead code and flattening nested conditionals
- Keep changes small and focused for safety
