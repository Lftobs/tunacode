# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- Successfully completed parallel execution implementation for read-only tools
- Implemented ToolBuffer class to batch read-only tool calls
- Created buffering callback wrapper that intercepts and batches tools
- Modified _process_node to use buffering system without major refactoring
- Added concurrency limiting via TUNACODE_MAX_PARALLEL environment variable
- All acceptance tests now pass - parallel execution confirmed working
- Removed prototype file parallel_process_node.py after successful implementation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue with characterization tests for Main Agent (`src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py`)
2. Add StateManager tests (`src/tunacode/core/state.py`)
3. Test CommandRegistry & Commands (`src/tunacode/cli/commands.py`)

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Continue capturing exact current behavior without fixing bugs (golden-master approach)
- High priority: Agent system tests, State management tests
- Medium priority: ToolHandler, SetupCoordinator, REPL tests
- Parallel execution feature is now complete and working
