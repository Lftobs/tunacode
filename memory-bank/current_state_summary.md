# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- QA'd PR 739f2be: Successfully added 54 characterization tests for core file tools
- Achieved excellent coverage: ReadFile 91%, WriteFile 89%, Bash 75%, UpdateFile 71%
- All tests follow golden-master pattern correctly (capture exact behavior, no fixes)
- Tests comprehensively cover edge cases: empty files, non-existent files, unicode, permissions, timeouts
- No source code modifications - purely characterization tests

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement characterization tests for Main Agent (`src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py`)
2. Add StateManager tests (`src/tunacode/core/state.py`)
3. Test CommandRegistry & Commands (`src/tunacode/cli/commands.py`)

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Need to capture exact current behavior without fixing bugs (golden-master approach)
- High priority: Agent system, State management, Command system
- Medium priority: ToolHandler, SetupCoordinator, REPL
- Focus on critical paths first to enable safe refactoring
