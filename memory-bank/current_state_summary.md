# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- Fixed parallel execution to actually work when multiple read-only tools are in a single node
- Modified _process_node to detect all-read-only batches and execute them in parallel
- Updated buffering callback to not execute read-only tools individually
- Added clear visual feedback showing "PARALLEL BATCH" with performance metrics
- Fixed visual feedback tests to match new output format
- Parallel execution now provides actual speedup (e.g., 3x-50x faster) for batched tools

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue with characterization tests for Main Agent (`src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py`)
2. Add StateManager tests (`src/tunacode/core/state.py`)
3. Test CommandRegistry & Commands (`src/tunacode/cli/commands.py`)

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Parallel execution works within single nodes (when model sends multiple tools)
- Cross-node batching limited by pydantic-ai architecture (agent expects immediate returns)
- Continue capturing exact current behavior without fixing bugs (golden-master approach)
- High priority: Agent system tests, State management tests
