# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- Successfully updated default tooling call iterations from 20 to 40:
  - Updated `DEFAULT_USER_CONFIG` in `defaults.py` 
  - Updated fallback value in `main.py` line 660
  - Fixed outdated fallback (15 â†’ 40) in `commands.py` line 201
- Increased max iterations limit from 50 to 100:
  - Updated validation in `/iterations` command
  - Updated usage messages to reflect new range (1-100)
- Created comprehensive characterization test:
  - Tests capture all iteration limit behaviors
  - Followed TDD approach - wrote tests first, then made changes
  - All tests pass after updates
  - No regressions in existing test suite

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue finding and fixing nested conditionals that can be flattened with guard clauses
2. Look for more dead code patterns (unused functions, imports, variables)
3. Apply other small improvements like normalizing symmetries
4. Continue with characterization tests for Main Agent (`src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py`)

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Focus on code cleanup and refactoring patterns from the style guide
- Prioritize removing dead code and flattening nested conditionals
- Keep changes small and focused for safety
