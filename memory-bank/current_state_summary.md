# Current State Summary

## Last Session Outcome
- Updated documentation to reflect recent feature additions:
  - Added new `list_dir` tool to developer tools list (now 7 tools total)
  - Created dedicated "Performance Features" section highlighting parallel execution
  - Added "List Directory Tool Features" section with detailed capabilities
  - Emphasized async/parallel nature of read-only tools (`read_file`, `grep`, `list_dir`)
  - Documented the 3-5x performance improvements from true async I/O

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue finding and fixing nested conditionals that can be flattened with guard clauses
2. Look for more dead code patterns (unused functions, imports, variables)
3. Apply other small improvements like normalizing symmetries
4. Continue with characterization tests for Main Agent (`src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py`)

## Key Blockers or Decisions
- Focus on code cleanup and refactoring patterns from the style guide
- Prioritize removing dead code and flattening nested conditionals
- Keep changes small and focused for safety
