# Wire TUNACODE.md context loading to agent following strict TDD
_Started: 2025-06-22 14:24:15_

## Plan â€” 2025-06-22 14:24:23
1. Write acceptance test for TUNACODE.md context injection 2. Implement context loading in agent 3. Add unit tests for each part 4. Wire context to system prompt 5. Test edge cases 6. Refactor for clarity

[1] Found existing context.py with get_context() and get_code_style() functions that read TUNACODE.md
[2] Agent creation loads system prompt from file but doesn't inject TUNACODE.md context
[3] Test failed as expected - Agent doesn't have _system_prompt attribute
[4] Agent object from conftest is being used instead of real pydantic_ai Agent
[5] Test fails as expected - need to implement context injection in agent creation
[6] Added context injection to agent creation - now loads TUNACODE.md and appends to system prompt
[7] Test shows that asyncio.run() can't be called from async context - need to fix implementation
[8] Fixed async issue by using sync file reading directly in agent creation
[9] All tests pass! Context injection is working - Green phase complete
[10] Linter found unused import - need to remove it
[11] Tests are failing due to mock issues with print functions - UI output was refactored by linter
