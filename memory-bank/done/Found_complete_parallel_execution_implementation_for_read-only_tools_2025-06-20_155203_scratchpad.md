[1] Found main agent file with parallel execution implementation. Looking for READ_ONLY_TOOLS constant
[2] Found READ_ONLY_TOOLS = [read_file, grep, list_dir, glob]. Now checking test files for parallel execution tests
[3] Found test files showing parallel execution logic and batching. Looking for visual feedback implementation
[4] Found visual feedback test showing PARALLEL BATCH messages. Now checking environment variable handling
