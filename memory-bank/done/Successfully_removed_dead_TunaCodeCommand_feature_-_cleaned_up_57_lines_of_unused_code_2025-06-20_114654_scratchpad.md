_Started: 2025-06-20 11:46:21_

[1] Identified TunaCodeCommand as dead code - fully implemented BM25 search feature but disabled in registration
[2] Removed TunaCodeCommand class (57 lines) from src/tunacode/cli/commands.py
[3] Removed commented registration line for TunaCodeCommand
[4] SimpleCommand base class is actively used by 13 commands - not dead code
