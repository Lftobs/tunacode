## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.33] - 2025-06-21

### Changed

- **Increased default iteration limits** for more complex reasoning tasks
  - Default max_iterations increased from 20 to 40
  - Maximum allowed iterations via `/iterations` command increased from 50 to 100
  - Fixed outdated fallback value (15 â†’ 40) in iterations command display
  - Benefits: Allows AI to handle more complex multi-step tasks without hitting limits

### Added

- Comprehensive characterization tests for iteration limits behavior
- Characterization tests for tool UI behavior capturing read-only tool optimizations

### Fixed

- Aligned all iteration limit defaults across the codebase
  - Updated defaults.py, main.py, and commands.py to use consistent values
  - Fixed discrepancy where commands.py showed 15 as default instead of the actual default

## [0.0.32] - 2025-06-20

### Fixed

- Cleaned up root directory by removing 100+ test files
  - Removed performance test files (perf_test_*.txt)
  - Removed test plan markdown files from root
  - Removed test api/components directories from src
  - Removed various test files (file*.txt, module_*.py, etc.)
  - Kept all legitimate test files in tests/ directory

## [0.0.31] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- New `list_dir` tool for efficient directory listing
  - Uses `os.scandir` for better performance than shell commands
  - Supports pagination with configurable max entries (default 200)
  - Shows file type indicators (/, *, @, ?)
  - Sorts results with directories first, then files alphabetically
  - Optional hidden file display with `show_hidden` parameter
  - Graceful permission error handling
  - Provides a fallback when bash commands aren't available

- System prompt optimizations for better parallel execution
  - Updated prompt to encourage 3-4 tool batches for optimal performance
  - Added clear examples showing why 3-4 tools is the sweet spot
  - Explained performance benefits: balances speed with cognitive load
  - Added "Why 3-4 Tools is Optimal" section with real-world timing examples

### Changed

- **Major Performance Improvement**: Made parallel tool execution truly asynchronous
  - Added `asyncio.to_thread()` to `read_file` and `list_dir` tools to prevent blocking the event loop
  - File operations now run in separate threads, enabling genuine parallel execution
  - Achieved 3-5x performance improvement for multiple file operations
  - Tests confirm multiple threads are used and operations run concurrently
  - Zero breaking changes - just 4 lines of code modified
  - Benefits: 3x faster file reads, non-blocking I/O, better responsiveness

- Refactored command structure to use declarative class-level metadata
  - Modified `SimpleCommand` base class to read properties from class-level `spec` attribute
  - Removed unnecessary `__init__` methods from 11 SimpleCommand subclasses
  - Commands now define their metadata declaratively as class attributes
  - Special handling preserved for `HelpCommand` and `CompactCommand` which require dependency injection
  - Benefits: Cleaner code, better readability, reduced boilerplate

### Removed

- Dead code cleanup in commands system
  - Removed `TunaCodeCommand` class (57 lines) - a fully implemented but disabled BM25 search feature
  - Removed associated TODO comment for the disabled command

## [0.0.30] - 2025-06-14

### Added

- File context visibility improvements
  - Files in context now always display after agent responses (not just when thoughts mode is enabled)
  - Shows only filenames for better readability instead of full paths
  - Tracks files referenced with @ syntax alongside files read through tools
- Enhanced `/thoughts` command display
  - Simplified tool arguments display for common file operations
  - Shows "Reading: filename.py" instead of full JSON for read_file tool
  - Truncates long commands to 60 characters for better readability
  - Maintains detailed JSON display for other tools
  - Added token counting for model responses

### Fixed

- Fixed error when tool arguments were strings instead of dictionaries
- Improved error handling for non-standard tool argument formats
- Fixed aggressive file writing when using @ file references
  - Added clear "FILE REFERENCE" headers to distinguish referenced content from code to write
  - Updated system prompt to understand @ syntax is for providing context, not for file creation
  - Changed model behavior from "TOOLS FIRST, ALWAYS" to "UNDERSTAND CONTEXT" for better interpretation
- Fixed "string indices must be integers" error in fallback responses
  - Improved AgentRunWrapper attribute resolution to properly handle result attribute conflicts
  - Used __getattribute__ instead of __getattr__ to ensure correct attribute precedence
  - Prevents errors when agent reaches max iterations and generates fallback response

## [0.0.29] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Comprehensive fallback response mechanism when agent reaches maximum iterations without user response (#22)
  - Response state tracking across all agent types (main agent, readonly agent, orchestrator)
  - Configurable fallback verbosity levels (minimal, normal, detailed)
  - Context extraction showing tool calls, files modified, and commands run in fallback responses
- Configuration option `fallback_response` to enable/disable fallback responses
- Automatic synthesis of incomplete task status when max iterations reached

### Fixed

- Orchestrator bug where fallback responses appeared even when tasks produced output (#22)
- Response state tracking to ensure fallback only triggers when no user-visible output exists

### Changed

- Improved fallback response mechanism to handle edge cases across different agent types

## [0.0.28] - 2025-06-08

### Added

- Enhanced `/compact` command with summary visibility:
  - Displays AI-generated summary in a cyan-bordered panel before truncating
  - Shows message count before and after compaction
  - Improved summary extraction logic supporting multiple model response formats
- Streamlined documentation structure:
  - Created FEATURES.md for complete feature reference
  - Created ARCHITECTURE.md for technical details
  - Created DEVELOPMENT.md for contributing guidelines
  - Created ADVANCED-CONFIG.md for detailed configuration

### Changed

- `/compact` command now shows what was summarized instead of operating silently
- README streamlined to focus on quick installation and basic usage
- Moved detailed documentation to separate files for better organization
