Product Requirements Document: Fix TunaCode UI Safety Branch Warning

Problem Statement:
The TunaCode CLI is displaying an incorrect safety warning message that contains formatting issues. When running without a safety branch, the error message shows raw ANSI color codes instead of properly formatted text.

Current Behavior:
- Error message displays: "Working Without Safety Branch ... You've chosen to work directly on your current branch. TunaCode will modify files in place. Make sure you have backups!"
- The message contains visible color codes: "[1] Yes (default)" shows as raw text with ANSI codes
- Text "Thinking..." appears misaligned

Expected Behavior:
- Clean, properly formatted warning message without visible ANSI escape sequences
- Properly aligned and readable confirmation options
- Clear visual hierarchy in the terminal output

Technical Requirements:
1. Fix ANSI color code rendering in the safety branch warning dialog
2. Ensure proper text alignment for all UI elements
3. Maintain consistent formatting with other TunaCode prompts
4. Test across different terminal emulators

Success Criteria:
- No visible ANSI escape sequences in output
- Clean, professional appearance
- Consistent with TunaCode's existing UI patterns
- Works on common terminal environments (bash, zsh, Windows Terminal)
