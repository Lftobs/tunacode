# Documentation Reorganization - June 18, 2025

## Overview
Reorganized the project documentation structure by consolidating all documentation files into a centralized `docs/` directory for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
- **Created** `docs/` directory as the central documentation hub
- **Created** subdirectories:
  - `docs/assets/` - for images and media files
  - `docs/changelog/` - for version history

### 2. File Relocations
The following files were moved from the root and `documentation/` directories to the new structure:

#### From `documentation/` to `docs/`:
- All date-stamped development session files (2025-*)
- Technical documentation files:
  - `ADVANCED-CONFIG.md`
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
  - `FEATURES.md`
  - `TOOLS.md`
  - `agent_flows.md`
- Planning and improvement documents:
  - `compact-command-improvement-plan.md`
  - `fast-glob-prefilter-enhancement.md`
  - `grep-search-improvements.md`
  - `parallelization-analysis.md`
- Quality assurance and review documents:
  - `performance_improvement_qa_report.md`
  - `qa_report.md`
  - `security_review.md`
  - `spelling-fixes.md`
  - `react-agent-improvements.md`

#### From root to `docs/`:
- `CODEBASE_TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md`
- `MAIN_AGENT_CHARACTERIZATION_GUIDE.md`

#### From root to `docs/assets/`:
- `demo.gif`
- `screenshot.gif`
- `tunacode_logo.jpg`

#### From root to `docs/changelog/`:
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### 3. Reference Updates
- Updated `README.md` to point to the new location of `demo.gif` at `docs/assets/demo.gif`

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner root directory** - Reduces clutter in the project root
2. **Better organization** - All documentation is now in one predictable location
3. **Easier navigation** - Related documents are grouped together
4. **Improved maintainability** - Clear separation between code and documentation

## Migration Notes
- All internal references to documentation files need to be updated to reflect the new paths
- The `documentation/` directory can be removed after verification
- Git history is preserved through proper file moves (git mv)

## Next Steps
1. Update any remaining references in the codebase to point to the new documentation locations
2. Update CI/CD scripts if they reference documentation files
3. Update any external links or documentation that reference the old file locations
