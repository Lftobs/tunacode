# Development Session Notes - January 27, 2025

## Session Overview
This session involved significant cleanup and feature additions to the TunaCode (formerly TinyAgent) CLI tool.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Complete Telemetry Removal
**What**: Removed all telemetry and Sentry tracking from the codebase
**Why**: Privacy concerns and code simplification
**How**:
- Deleted `services/telemetry.py` and `core/setup/telemetry_setup.py`
- Removed `sentry_sdk` dependency from `pyproject.toml`
- Removed `--no-telemetry` CLI flag
- Cleaned up all telemetry references in state management and types
- Updated README and documentation

### 2. Git Safety Branch Feature
**What**: Added automatic creation of `-tunacode` branches on startup
**Why**: Protect users' work from unintended changes
**How**:
- Created `GitSafetySetup` class in `core/setup/git_safety_setup.py`
- Checks git status and offers to create safety branch (e.g., `develop-tunacode`)
- Handles edge cases: no git, not a repo, detached HEAD, existing branches
- Allows users to opt-out with warning about risks
- Integrated into setup coordinator

### 3. Init Command for Onboarding
**What**: Added `/init` command to generate TUNACODE.md files
**Why**: Help users document their project setup for better AI assistance
**How**:
- Created `InitCommand` that analyzes repository structure
- Added `context.py` module to gather git status, file structure, configs
- Added `ripgrep.py` utility wrapper for fast file searching
- Generates TUNACODE.md with build commands and conventions
- Merged from PR #6 into develop branch

### 4. ASCII Art Update
**What**: Changed startup banner from "TINYAGENT" to "TUNACODE"
**Why**: Reflect the project rename
**How**:
- Updated ASCII art in `ui/output.py`
- Changed color scheme to bright cyan
- Removed old two-tone comment

### 5. Command Cancellation Attempt (Reverted)
**What**: Tried to implement double-Esc and double-Ctrl+C to cancel commands
**Why**: Users wanted a way to stop long-running commands
**What we tried**:
1. Double-Esc keybinding with timer
2. prompt_toolkit's native `escape,escape` sequence
3. Signal handler for double Ctrl+C
4. `/stop` command
5. CancellableProcess wrapper with proper signal handling

**Why it failed**:
- Escape keys only work when in input mode, not during command execution
- Signal handlers conflicted with REPL's normal Ctrl+C behavior
- Added too much complexity for a simple feature

**Final decision**: Removed all cancellation logic to keep codebase simple

## Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed circular imports in command system
- Cleaned up unused imports and functions
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns
- Added proper type hints where missing

## Lessons Learned
1. **Keep It Simple**: Complex solutions (like signal handling) often create more problems than they solve
2. **Test Edge Cases**: The git safety feature handles many edge cases that could trip up users
3. **User Safety First**: The `-tunacode` branch feature protects users by default
4. **Clean As You Go**: Removing telemetry simplified many parts of the codebase

## Future Considerations
1. Command cancellation could be revisited with a different approach (perhaps using asyncio tasks)
2. The `/init` command could be enhanced with more intelligent analysis
3. Git safety feature could be extended to handle more scenarios
4. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for new features

## Files Most Affected
- `/src/tunacode/cli/commands.py` - Added InitCommand
- `/src/tunacode/core/setup/` - Added GitSafetySetup, removed TelemetrySetup
- `/src/tunacode/ui/output.py` - Updated ASCII art
- `/src/tunacode/context.py` - New file for repository analysis
- `/src/tunacode/utils/ripgrep.py` - New utility wrapper

## Git History Markers
- Telemetry removal: `dee757d`
- Init command addition: `bfec983`
- Command cancellation attempt: `cd026f9` to `37aff54`
- Final revert to simplicity: `53046a4`
